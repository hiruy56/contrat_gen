To document the provided FastAPI application that fills in a contract template, you can follow these steps:

### Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- `fastapi`
- `python-docx`

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install fastapi python-docx
```

### Code Explanation

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Imports**: Import necessary libraries and modules.

2. **FastAPI Setup**: Initialize a FastAPI instance (`app`).

3. **CORS Middleware**: Allow CORS for POST requests to enable cross-origin requests.

4. **fill_contract_template Function**: This function takes `contract_details` as input, replaces placeholders in a Word document template (`tomp.docx`) with corresponding values from `contract_details`, and returns a `BytesIO` stream of the filled document.

5. **POST Endpoint `/fill-contract`**: Defines a POST endpoint `/fill-contract` that accepts a JSON body (`contract_details`) containing the data to fill into the contract template. It calls `fill_contract_template` to get the filled document as a stream and returns it as a `StreamingResponse` with media type `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`.

6. **Main Execution**: Runs the FastAPI application using Uvicorn server.

### Example Usage

To use this API:

- Ensure `tomp.docx` exists in the same directory as your script, containing placeholders like `{key}` that match the keys in `contract_details`.
- Send a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/fill-contract` with JSON payload containing your contract details.
